# JOURNAL LOVE

Welcome to Journal Love (ReactProject)

Developed using Python and Django, Journal Love allows users to describe their feelings and receive input/advice.
To submit your first journal entry, register and log in. Then, add a post. After adding the post, click on the created post
and scroll to the "analyze" button. Click on the button and Journal Love's advice will appear.

Journal Love is deployed using Heroku and Gunicorn. Access it using the link below!
